exchangeIt is an application to get email in your OWA inbox.  It currently works with OWA 2003 as long as you have WebDAV enabled.  For the inbox URL, enter the full path to your inbox, including "/Inbox" on the end.  You can easily find this by going to OWA and right clicking the Inbox link on the left hand side, and copying that URL.  My inbox URL looks like:

https://mail.company.com/exchange/Brian.Yarger@company.com/Inbox

I'm working on ironing out the bugs and adding to the support.  Currently Basic auth is working (OWA pops up a login prompt) but forms based auth is not (typing username/password into a web page).  OWA 2007 is also not yet supported.
